# Hello World!

I decided to set up my own blog for recording ideas in daily life including life and technique.

I have built personal blogs many times (using Hexo, Jekyll, etc), but gave up to maintain on the way. I think the reason is that the whole pipeline is too complex to use. This is not to say these tools are hard to use, `complex` means extra dependencies makes it not simple and elegant.

And this time, I decide to restart my blog with only HTML files (I use Typora to export my articles as HTML file).

There will be mainly 2 kinds of articles:

- Some ideas and experiences of my daily life (mainly using Chinese).
- Some technique articles about renderings and others. (English & Chinese maybe).

Please feel free to contact me! (email address: gao-d17@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn, gaoduan0306@163.com)
